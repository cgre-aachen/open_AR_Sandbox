    "The sensor calibration is a bit more advanced than the projector positioning. In addition to the horizontal adjustment you also need to define vertical limits of the values, the sensor supplies.

It is easy to determine the sandboxe's edges and objects next to the sandbox, like the monitor or a chair. Position the Kinect sensor physically, so that the sensor is parallel to the sandbox surface and the outlines of the sandbox are parallel to the edges appears anymore. Each time, you have adjusted the hardware, take a new snapshot and check the visualization inside the calibration interface. Before a snapshot is taken, the software waits three seconds, allowing you to remove your hands or other objects between the sensor and the scanned surface.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, you can adjust the four margins more precisely following the life representation inside the sandbox. Place a recognizable object like a cube or a cylinder inside the sandbox to check for possible offsets. Do that in the center of the surface, as well as close to the the edges of the sandbox.\n",

    "Hold one hand right above the sandboxe's walls and move the yellow slider to the right until your hand is illuminated in yellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate the vertical maximum of the range, dig a hole inside the sand until you reach the bottom of the sandbox. Now, move the red slider until only the bottom plate is colored red. Move the slider a little bit further to the right to increase the distance slightly below the sandbox. You can always follow this process inside the interface to also get a feedback on the distances of surrounding objects behind the blue margin patches."
